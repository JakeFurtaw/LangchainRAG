# Towson AI Assistant
This is a chatbot that I am developing for a local startup. I am working to create a custom dataset and RAG implimentation for Llama2
that caters to new and existing students needs. 
This chatbat will be live on a website and app so that students can query it and get the information they need no matter where they are.

## Whats Being Used
I am using Llama 2, Langchain, as well as a multitude of other python modules to create the perfect chatbot to cater to students at local universities.
Refer to the [Requirements File](requirements.txt) for a full list of requirements used in this project.
