# Towson AI Assistant
I am developing a conversational AI assistant specifically for new and existing students at universities. This chatbot will be accessible via website and mobile app, allowing students to interact with it from anywhere to get the information they need. At its core is a custom dataset I've carefully curated with a wide range of relevant topics like course offerings, teacher information, enrollment procedures, campus resources, and more.

To power the chatbot, I'm implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipline and using Meta's Llama2 7B model. This combines retrieving pertinent info from the custom dataset with Llama2's fluent text generation abilities. The RAG model allows the chatbot to efficiently locate relevant data and generate natural, contextual responses tailored to each student's query. By deploying it on website and app, I aim to provide an easily accessible resource to enhance the overall student experience, facilitating smoother transitions and navigation through academia.

## Whats Being Used
I am using Llama 2, Langchain, as well as a multitude of other python libraries and frameworks to create the perfect chatbot to cater to students at local universities.
